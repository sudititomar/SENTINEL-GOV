# 🛡️ Sentinel-Gov

**An AI watchdog that verifies government projects and releases payments only after proven, on-time work.**

Sentinel-Gov is an **agentic AI governance system** that prevents public fund misuse by shifting verification **before payment**, not after damage.

## 🚨 The Problem

Government projects often fail not because of lack of funding, but because:
- Payments are released before work is verified
- Manual inspections and delayed audits miss ground reality
- Low-quality or incomplete work passes paper compliance
- Accountability comes too late, after money is already spent

Once money moves, damage is irreversible.

## 💡 The Solution

Sentinel-Gov introduces an **AI oversight layer** that:
- Verifies real-world execution using geo-tagged evidence
- Compares work quality against contract standards
- Releases payments only when work is verified and compliant
- Rewards honest, on-time contractors with performance incentives (5–7%)

The system intervenes **before** public money moves.
