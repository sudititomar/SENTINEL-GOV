# 🛡️ Sentinel-Gov

**A verification platform that ensures public money moves only after real work is proven.**

Just like **UPI built trust into digital payments**, **Sentinel-Gov builds trust into public spending**.

## 🚨 The Problem

Across roads, hospitals, schools, and food supply systems, the problem is the same:

- Payments are released before verification  
- Quality checks happen too late  
- Audits explain damage instead of preventing it  

Once money moves, accountability is lost.

---

## 💡 The Solution

Sentinel-Gov introduces a **verification layer** between execution and payment.

Before any public money is released, the system verifies:
- Whether the work was actually done  
- Whether it meets promised standards  

If work is not proven or standards are not met, **payment freezes automatically**.

No confrontation.  
No discretion.  
Just proof.

## 🤖 Agentic AI System

Sentinel-Gov is built using **agentic AI**, where each agent owns one irreversible decision:

- **Planner Agent**  
  Converts contracts into clear, measurable standards  

- **Verification Agent**  
  Verifies real-world evidence using time, location, and authenticity  

- **Comparison Agent**  
  Checks quality and compliance against contract standards  

- **Payment Agent**  
  Approves or freezes payment based on verified truth  

This separation of responsibility prevents manipulation and ensures accountability.

## 🌍 Where Sentinel-Gov Works

Because the verification flow is universal, Sentinel-Gov can be deployed across:

- Infrastructure projects  
- Government hospitals  
- Schools and government canteens  
- Public welfare and aid programs  

**Same system. Different rules.**
